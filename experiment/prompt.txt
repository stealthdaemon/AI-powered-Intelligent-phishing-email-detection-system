Analyze all parts of this email thoroughly for potential phishing indicators, prioritizing the validation of headers and URLs over the email content. 
    Pay special attention to the URLs, if present, and classify the email based on whether the links point to the same, trusted, legitimate domains. 
    If the email content appears to be a marketing or campaign message, or contains potential phishing indicators, focus on the legitimacy of the headers and URLs rather than the content itself. 
    Do not classify the email as phishing solely because of its content, unless there are inconsistencies in the headers or evidence that the links lead to different, malicious or suspicious domains. 
    When uncertain, lean toward classifying the email as 'Legitimate' if the headers are valid and any URLs point to the same trusted sources with no signs of malicious intent.

       - If the email appears to be a marketing or campaign message, prioritize the investigation of headers and URLs over the content.
